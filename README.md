# Firebase Initialization Error: Asynchronous Data Access

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Firebase: attempting to access the database before the Firebase app has fully initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The issue arises when asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from Firebase, are initiated before the Firebase app has been initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that database access occurs only after the Firebase app has successfully initialized. This is typically achieved using promises or async/await.
